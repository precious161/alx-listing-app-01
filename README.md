# ALX Listing App

A simple property listing application inspired by Airbnb, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Project Description

The **ALX Listing App** is a demo web application for browsing property listings, designed as a clone of an Airbnb-style listing page. This project demonstrates best practices in React component modularity, TypeScript type safety, and modern frontend styling using TailwindCSS.

## Project Structure

- **components/**  
  Contains all reusable UI components such as `Card`, `Button`, and others. These components are designed to be modular and composable across the app.

- **interfaces/**  
  Holds TypeScript interfaces for component props and data types. This ensures type safety and easier code maintenance.

- **constants/**  
  Stores any reusable data, configuration settings, API URLs, or UI text strings used throughout the application.

- **public/assets/**  
  Contains static assets such as images, SVGs, icons, and logos. These files are publicly accessible and used for visual content in the UI.
